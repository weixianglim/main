The player, a ghost fish, has the ability to possess any other fish within the vicinity to get them out of harm's way. As the game progresses, special fishes will also be available which the player can possess and destroy or hinder hazards with.

Contrary to popular belief, more mechanics does not necessarily equate to a better game. We were very confident that we will be able to develop a fun and engaging game without complex or bloated game mechanics. We also wanted a little twist and stray away from the usual game tropes. Instead of destroying enemies, we wanted to explore the idea of protection.

We also tried a flocking behavior for the fish movement, but the clustered nature of the fishes ended up hindering the gameplay as they are too easily caught by the nets.
