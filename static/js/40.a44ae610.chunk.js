The theme for this project is "Sexuality", and I\'ve decided to use a game as a medium for this creative project.

Picking up the blue object will invoke words like \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d, etc. while picking up the pink object will invoke more pleasant phrases like \u201cyou two look good together\u201d, \u201clovely couple\u201d, etc. These feelings would hopefully put players into the shoes of an individual who is struggling with their sexuality and facing public / social stigmatization along the way.
