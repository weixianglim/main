It is a colony simulator built on a custom 3D game engine whereby the player has to manage the game\'s crucial resource - Frulets. These Frulets are indispensable and are necessary to impede the "Apotcalypse". The main game loop revolves around managing the aforementioned Frulets, using them to craft various buildings and assigning them to work in different areas of the map. The main goal is to clear the infection levels of the different floors, mainly via the buildings available. Once all 4 floors of infections are cleared, the Apotcalypse will be prevented.'}),(0,g.jsx)("h3",{children:"Challenges"}),(0,g.jsx)("img",{src:d,alt:""}),(0,g.jsx)("p",{children:'We faced many challenges during the initial stage of the project. For starters, the game idea itself was obscure; everyone on the team was very new to the genre and there were many misconceptions of the game idea when it was pitched initially. We were also unsure of how the game will pan out in a 3D enrivonment as most existing games like "Oxygen Not Included" within the genre were 2D. Because of this, we ended up making several revamps and iterations throughout the course of this project which naturally ate up quite a large chunk of development time. Thankfully, the team gelled together really well during the whole ordeal and held many meetings to iterate the whole game idea from the bottom up. Thanks to the iteration process, we realised that the initial game concept does not work well in a 3D environment which ultimately directed the team in the proper direction. The final product ended up being something that I\'m very sastisfied with and Apotcalypse has become a project that I hold really close to heart!'}),(0,g.jsx)("h3",{children:"Iterations"}),(0,g.jsx)("p",{children:"The initial game concept was actually drastically different from the end product.

The game revolves around resources and requires players to be very reactive when an event happens in the game loop. Infection meter rising? Build a cleaner room quickly. Frulets are dying? Craft a hospital room immediately. The circular pot acted as a huge hindrance to this core mechanic - the entire environment is not fully visible to the player at any one time! When an event is happening at the back of the pot, the player might not be aware of it. Even if they were made aware, the process of rotating the pot to the back and getting to the correct floor is way too slow and were at many times too detrimental to come back from. Environmental maneuvering became a huge part of the gameplay and was not an intended style of playing. With that, the team decided to scrap the current concept and revamped the environment."}),(0,g.jsx)("h3",{children:"The New Design"}),(0,g.jsx)("p",{children:"The environment was redesigned to allow players to have have a complete view of the map. The aspect of environment maneuver (rotating the pot) was completely scrapped and players no longer have to manipulate the map to access their Frulets. Additionally, raycasting is now utilised as the primary way for players to engage with the Frulet resources - simply drag and drop them into the desired slots. The players are still able to zoom into the individual rooms to engage with the Frulets, but the bulk of the game can be played via drag and drop.
